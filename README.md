# OpenFit Bike - Smart Fitness Electronics System

A comprehensive smart bike electronics system that transforms a static indoor bike into an intelligent fitness tracking platform with AI coaching capabilities.

## üéØ Project Vision

This project is the foundation of a holistic health system built from the ground up, starting with custom electronics for an indoor static bike. The goal is to create an integrated ecosystem that tracks workouts, syncs with platforms like Strava, and eventually incorporates AI-powered coaching.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system consists of two ESP32-based modules that work together to provide comprehensive bike monitoring:

### 1. Internals Module (`/internals/`)
**Hardware**: ESP32 Dev Board  
**Purpose**: Core sensor data collection and BLE communication

**Features**:
- **Cadence Sensing**: Reed/Hall sensor on crank (2 magnets per revolution)
- **Resistance Measurement**: Analog resistance knob monitoring via ADC
- **Power Calculation**: Torque-based power estimation using calibrated LUT
- **Speed Calculation**: Virtual speed based on gear ratio and wheel circumference
- **BLE Broadcasting**: FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) protocol for app connectivity
- **Calibration System**: Interactive 3-point resistance calibration
- **Persistent Settings**: Configuration stored in ESP32 preferences

**Technical Specs**:
- Device Name: "LibrePulse Bike"
- Communication: BLE FTMS Indoor Bike Data (UUID: 0x2AD2)
- Update Rate: 10Hz sensor broadcasting
- Power Range: 0.5-25 Nm torque model with customizable LUT

### 2. Display Module (`/display/`)
**Hardware**: Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 TFT  
**Purpose**: Visual feedback and user interface

**Status**: Basic PlatformIO setup (development in progress)  
**Future Plans**: 
- Real-time metrics display
- Workout session tracking
- Configuration interface
- Connectivity status indicators

## üîß Hardware Setup

### Components Used
- **Main Controller**: ESP32 Dev Board
- **Display Unit**: Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 with capacitive display
- **Sensors**: 
  - Reed/Hall sensor for cadence (GPIO 27)
  - Analog resistance sensor (GPIO 34)
- **Original Bike**: Repurposed static indoor bike with custom electronics

### Wiring
- Cadence sensor: GPIO 27 (with internal pullup)
- Resistance sensor: GPIO 34 (ADC1, 12-bit resolution)
- Serial debugging: 115200 baud

*Note*: Two ESP32s were used due to connector availability constraints for the display unit.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PlatformIO IDE
- ESP32 development environment
- Static bike with resistance knob mechanism

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd openfit-bike
   ```

2. **Flash the internals module**
   ```bash
   cd internals
   pio run --target upload
   ```

3. **Flash the display module** (when ready)
   ```bash
   cd display/openfit-display
   pio run --target upload
   ```

### Initial Calibration

1. Connect to the internals module via serial (115200 baud)
2. Run the calibration command: `cal`
3. Follow the 3-point calibration process:
   - **FREE**: Knob fully loose (no resistance)
   - **ENGAGE**: Point where resistance just starts
   - **HIGH**: Maximum comfortable resistance level

### Configuration Commands

The internals module provides a rich command interface:

- `cal` - Run resistance calibration
- `show` - Display current settings
- `raw` - Monitor raw ADC values
- `setcirc <mm>` - Set wheel circumference (1500-3000mm)
- `setratio <ratio>` - Set gear ratio (0.3-5.0)
- `settorque <min> <max>` - Configure torque range
- `setlut <idx> <val>` - Customize power curve
- `help` - Show all commands
